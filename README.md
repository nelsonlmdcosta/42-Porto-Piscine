This repository contains my work for the **42 Piscine**.  
It includes the exercises (`C00`–`C08`) and Rush projects (`Rush00`, `Rush01`), along with the official PDFs for reference.  

⚠️ **Note**: The repository is intended for exploration, learning, and reference. Please respect the 42 honor code — try solving the problems yourself first before peeking.  
⚠️ **Note**: This is still WIP so expect a lot of changes to structure and code that hasn't been submitted
⚠️ **Note**: This github uses submodules, the documents are licenced, so I cannot upload them. This is more for me :p - git submodule update --init --recursive

## ⚡ Notes on Code Quality
Most of this was done under piscine time pressure 😅.  
There are almost certainly more optimal ways to solve some exercises.  
Think of this as “working solutions” rather than “perfect reference code.”

## 🛠 Requirements
- **CLion**: Currently tested with **CL-252.23892.426**  
- **Python**: 3.13  
- **Norminette**: Installed via Python

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### CLion Project Setup
- All projects are configured for **CLion on Windows**.  
- The provided `CMakeLists.txt` works out of the box for that environment.  
- On **Linux/macOS**, CMake may need tweaking (paths, toolchains, or compilation flags).  
- ⚠️ If you add new files or don’t see build targets, use **File → Reload CMake Project**.  

### Norminette Setup
Install norminette globally via pip:  
```bash
pip install norminette
